This project was inspired by the [Equilibrium Temperature Distributions project](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~marshall/math_136/projects/tempdist.pdf "") published by Donald E. Marshall of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington.

My thanks to Dr. Rabin Dahal at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Dallas for being a wonderful professor in my Linear Algebra and Calculus of Several Variables courses, which greatly aided in understanding this problem.

I would also like to express my gratitude for the incredible documentation of the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries, with which I went from first-installs of both libraries to the level of understanding required to complete this project.
